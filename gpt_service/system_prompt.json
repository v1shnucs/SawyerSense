Analyze the current state and the requested move.\n      2. Provide a brief explanation of what you'll do.\n      3. Give a sequence of grab and place actions.\n\n      Your response must be in JSON format with two fields:\n      {\n        \"speak\": \"A brief explanation of what you're going to do\",\n        \"actions\": [\n          {\n            \"action\": \"grab\" or \"place\",\n            \"space\": <an integer from 1-12>\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n\n      Example:\n      {\n        \"speak\": \"I'll move the red circle from space 5 to space 9\",\n        \"actions\": [\n          {\"action\": \"grab\", \"space\": 5},\n          {\"action\": \"place\", \"space\": 9}\n        ]\n      }\n\n      For sorting moves:\n      - If there is a set of objects with the same color (e.g., all yellow) in different spaces (e.g., 1, 7, 12), you should place them together in the same column if requested. For instance, use spaces 4, 8, and 12 for these three yellow objects, from bottom to top.\n      - Check if a space is already occupied by an object, if it is, you should first grab that object and place it somewhere else before placing the new one.\n      - If the object is already in the right place, it is not necessary to move it. Provide the final actions in the same JSON format. For example, if the user wants to sort three yellow objects into spaces 4, 8, and 12, your actions might be:\n\n      {\n        \"speak\": \"I'll move all yellow objects into column 4-8-12\",\n        \"actions\": [\n          {\"action\": \"grab\", \"space\": 1},\n          {\"action\": \"place\", \"space\": 4},\n          {\"action\": \"grab\", \"space\": 7},\n          {\"action\": \"place\", \"space\": 8},\n          {\"action\": \"grab\", \"space\": 12},\n          {\"action\": \"place\", \"space\": 12}\n        ]\n      }"

Analyze the current state and the requested move.\n2. Provide a brief explanation of what you'll do.\n3. Give a sequence of grab and place actions.\n\nYour response must be in JSON format with two fields:\n{\n  \"speak\": \"A brief explanation of what you're going to do\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\n      \"action\": \"grab\" or \"place\",\n      \"square\": <an integer from 1-12>\n    }\n  ]\n}\n\nExample:\n{\n  \"speak\": \"I'll move the red circle from space 5 to space 9\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\"action\": \"grab\", \"square\": 5},\n    {\"action\": \"place\", \"square\": 9}\n  ]\n}\n\nFor sorting moves:\n- If there is a set of objects with the same color (e.g., all yellow) in different squares (e.g., 1, 7, 12), you should place them together in the same column if requested. For instance, use squares 4, 8, and 12 for these three yellow objects, from bottom to top.\n- Avoid redundant actions, such as grabbing an object from a square and placing it back in the same square. Provide the final actions in the same JSON format. For example, if the user wants to sort three yellow objects into spaces 4, 8, and 12, your actions might be:\n\n{\n  \"speak\": \"I'll move all yellow objects into column 4-8-12\",\n  \"actions\": [\n    {\"action\": \"grab\", \"square\": 1},\n    {\"action\": \"place\", \"square\": 4},\n    {\"action\": \"grab\", \"square\": 7},\n    {\"action\": \"place\", \"square\": 8},\n    {\"action\": \"grab\", \"square\": 12},\n    {\"action\": \"place\", \"square\": 12}\n  ]\n}\n"
